# Todo List in Terminal

In this project, we'll be creating a Todo Board to track tasks that need to be completed. You'll be creating this entire project from scratch, no skeleton or specs!

We'll be writing two phases of this project, with the second expanding functionality with a refactor:

* A board that manages a single todo list
* A board that manages multiple todo lists with extended features for lists and items.
